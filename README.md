<h3>VBA Challenge</h3>
This project is a VBA macro designed to analyze stock market data. The macro loops through multiple worksheets containing data for different stock tickers and calculates the yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume for each ticker. It also highlights positive yearly changes in green and negative yearly changes in red.</br>
</br>
<p>This script loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ticker symbol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The total stock volume of the stock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This VBA script is enabled to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.</p>
</li>
</ul>
